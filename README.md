## Introduction
Blogging has become such a mania that a new blog is being created every second of every minute of every hour of every day. A blog is your best bet for a voice among the online crowd. Blogs were usually the work of a single individual occasionally of a small group. and often covered a single subject.
This web-app is a blogging website where we are using type clustering method to seperate the subjects of blog. A machine learning Algorithm is used to detect the type of cluster. A recommandation system to recommend all user about the new blog and according to their interest.


## Objectives
* To enhance the communication and writing skills of individuals.

* To popularize the importance of the blogging culture starting from primary levels to the professional levels.

* To network with people having common interest and sharing their thought. 

* Promotes autonomous learning by providing opportunities for students to take more control of their learning

## Proposed_System
* The proposed system will have a much more user friendly as well as interactive interface which is not distracting for  the readers.

* The recommendation system of the proposed system will not only rely on keywords and the title but also analyse the Github and LinkedIn profile of the user.

* Based on the tags, through NLP, it decides the node container of the blog which help the recommender system to provide better recomendations.​
